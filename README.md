## iPhone GPT chat client using a state-driven, unidirectional dataflow architecture.
  If you hire me as your iOS (Re)Architecture lead, I will extend this framework.

## Description

This app uses unidirectional data flow to manage state and is implemented with Combine.

• State machine (Store.swift) adapted from https://obscuredpixels.com/managing-view-state-with-combine

## To-Do

• SwiftUI autoscrolling not working (at least in Xcode 13.2.1 / iOS 15.2)
